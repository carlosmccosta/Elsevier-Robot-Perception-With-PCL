@article{Segal2009,
abstract = {In this paper we combine the Iterative Closest Point (’ICP’) and ‘point-to-plane ICP‘ algorithms into a single probabilistic framework. We then use this framework to model locally planar surface structure from both scans instead of just the ”model” scan as is typically done with the point-to-plane method. This can be thought of as ‘plane-to-plane’. The new approach is tested with both simulated and real-world data and is shown to outperform both standard ICP and point-to-plane. Furthermore, the new approach is shown to be more robust to incorrect correspondences, and thus makes it easier to tune the maximum match distance parameter present in most variants of ICP. In addition to the demonstrated performance improvement, the proposed model allows for more expressive probabilistic models to be incorporated into the ICP framework. While maintaining the speed and simplicity of ICP, the Generalized-ICP could also allow for the addition of outlier terms, measurement noise, and other probabilistic techniques to increase robustness.},

First, the performance of static localization using power maps (PMs) is improved with a new approach called the base-station-strict (BS-strict) methodology, which emphasizes the effect of BS identities in the classical fingerprinting. Second, dynamic motion models with and without road network information are used to further improve the accuracy via particle filters. The likelihood-calculation mechanism proposed for the particle filters is interpreted as a soft version (called BS-soft) of the BS-strict approach applied in the static case. The results of the proposed approaches are illustrated and compared with an example whose data were collected from a WiMAX network in a challenging urban area in the capitol city of Brussels, Belgium.},

abstract = {In this work we address the problem of optimal Bayesian filtering for dynamic systems with observation models that cannot be approximated properly as any parameterized distribution. In the context of mobile robots this problem arises in localization and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) with occupancy grid maps. The lack of a parameterized observation model for these maps forces a sample-based representation, commonly through Monte Carlo methods for sequential filtering, also called particle filters. Our work is grounded on the demonstrated existence of an optimal proposal distribution for particle filters. However, this optimal distribution is not directly applicable to systems with non-parametric models. By integrating ideas from previous works on adaptive sample size, auxiliary particle filters, and rejection sampling, we derive a new particle filter algorithm that enables the usage of the optimal proposal to estimate the true posterior density of a non-parametric dynamic system. This new filter is better suited, both theoretically and in practice, than previous approximate methods for indoor and outdoor localization and SLAM, as confirmed by experiments with real robots.},

The definition is based on local maps from differential geometry, which are approximated by the method of moving least squares (MLS). The computation of points on the surface is local, which results in an out-of-core technique that can handle any point set. We show that the approximation error is bounded and present tools to increase or decrease the density of the points, thus allowing an adjustment of the spacing among the points to control the error. To display the point set surface, we introduce a novel point rendering technique. The idea is to evaluate the local maps according to the image resolution. This results in high quality shading effects and smooth silhouettes at interactive frame rates.},

This paper presents a lidar-based perception system for passenger-cars, able to do simultaneously mapping and moving obstacles detection. Nowadays, many lidars provide multi-layer and multi-echo measurements. A smart way to handle this multi-modality is to use grids projected on the road surface in both global and local frames. The global one generates the mapping and the local is used to deal with moving objects. An approach based on both positive and negative accumulation has been developed to address the remnant problem of quickly moving obstacles. This method is also well suited for multi-layer and multi-echo sensors. Experimental results carried out with an IBEO Alasca and an Applanix positioning system show the performance of such a perception strategy.},

abstract = {For robust 3D object recognition in the environment having diverse variances, it is necessary to increase the certainty by using consecutive scenes rather than using a single scene and combining different features. This paper proposes a novel 3D object recognition and pose estimation approach based on combining photometric feature (SIFT) and geometric feature (3D lines) in a sequence of scenes. In order to utilize the consecutive scenes, we use the particle filtering method and all particles which represent the possible pose of object are generated by each feature. These particles are to be spread out where the object is considered to exist, and the probability of each particle is obtained through matching test with each feature in the scene. Then the particle sets derived from SIFT and 3D lines are fused and it gives a pose of the object estimated. For the sake of computational efficiency, this recognition system is performed in a hierarchical process. In this paper, we also introduce a simple method to decide the next best view position based on results of recognition. Lastly we have proved through experiments that the proposed methods are feasible},

abstract = {Several new methods are presented for selecting n records at random without replacement from a file containing N records. Each algorithm selects the records for the sample in a sequential manner\&mdash;in the same order the records appear in the file. The algorithms are online in that the records for the sample are selected iteratively with no preprocessing. The algorithms require a constant amount of space and are short and easy to implement. The main result of this paper is the design and analysis of Algorithm D, which does the sampling in O ( n )  time, on the average; roughly n uniform random variates are generated, and approximately n exponentiation operations (of the form a b , for real numbers a and b) are performed during the sampling. This solves an open problem in the literature. CPU timings on a large mainframe computer indicate that Algorithm D is significantly faster than the sampling algorithms in use today.},

In this paper, we propose a state-of-the-art, modular, and efficient implementation of an ICP library. We took advantage of the recent availability of fast depth cameras to demonstrate one application example: a 3D pose tracker running at 30 Hz. For this application, we show the modularity of our ICP library by optimizing the use of lean and simple descriptors in order to ease the matching of 3D point clouds. This tracker is then evaluated using datasets recorded along a ground truth of millimeter accuracy. We provide both source code and datasets to the community in order to accelerate further comparisons in this field.},

to include elements of nonlinearity and non-Gaussianity in order to
model accurately the underlying dynamics of a physical system. Moreover,
it is typically crucial to process data on-line as it arrives, both from
the point of view of storage costs as well as for rapid adaptation to
changing signal characteristics. In this paper, we review both optimal

problems, with a focus on particle filters. Particle filters are
sequential Monte Carlo methods based on point mass (or "particle")
representations of probability densities, which can be applied to any
state-space model and which generalize the traditional Kalman filtering
methods. Several variants of the particle filter such as SIR, ASIR, and
RPF are introduced within a generic framework of the sequential

The quality of alignment obtained by this algorithm depends heavily on choosing good pairs of corresponding points in the two datasets. If too many points are chosen from featureless regions of the data, the algorithm converges slowly, finds the wrong pose, or even diverges, especially in the presence of noise or miscalibration in the input data. We describe a method for detecting uncertainty in pose, and we propose a point selection strategy for ICP that minimizes this uncertainty by choosing samples that constrain potentially unstable transformations.},

In this paper we propose a novel approach for estimating the egomotion of the vehicle from a sequence of stereo images. Our method is directly based on the trifocal geometry between image triples, thus no time expensive recovery of the 3-dimensional scene structure is needed. The only assumption we make is a known camera geometry, where the calibration may also vary over time. We employ an Iterated Sigma Point Kalman Filter in combination with a RANSAC-based outlier rejection scheme which yields robust frame-to-frame motion estimation even in dynamic environments. A high-accuracy inertial navigation system is used to evaluate our results on challenging real-world video sequences. Experiments show that our approach is clearly superior compared to other filtering techniques in terms of both, accuracy and run-time.},

abstract = {Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms with multiple autonomous robots have received considerable attention in recent years. In general, SLAM algorithms use odometry information and measurements from exteroceptive sensors of robots. The accuracy of these measurements and the performance of the corresponding SLAM algorithm directly affect the overall success of the system. This paper presents comparative performance evaluations of three Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms using Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), Compressed Extended Kalman Filter (CEKF) and Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). Specifically, it focuses on their SLAM performances and processing time requirements. To show the effect of CPU power on the processing time of SLAM algorithms, two notebooks and a netbook with different specifications have been used. Comparative simulation results show that processing time requirements are consistent with the computational complexities of SLAM algorithms. The results we obtained are consistent with the CPU power tests of independent organizations and show that higher processing power decreases processing time accordingly. The results also show that CEKF is more suitable for outdoor SLAM applications where there are a lot of natural and artificial features.},

The classification task is stated as a 3D retrieval task finding the nearest neighbors from synthetically generated views of CAD-models to the sensed point cloud with a Kinect-style depth sensor. The presented shape descriptor shows that the combination of angle, point-distance and area shape functions gives a significant boost in recognition rate against the baseline descriptor and outperforms the state-of-the-art descriptors in our experimental evaluation on a publicly available dataset of real-world objects in table scene contexts with up to 200 categories.},

In addition, we present a highly efficient indexing scheme for the high dimensional ISS shape descriptors, allowing for fast and accurate search of large model databases.

abstract = {Rigid registration of two geometric data sets is essential in many applications, including robot navigation, surface reconstruction, and shape matching. Most commonly, variants of the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm are employed for this task. These methods alternate between closest point computations to establish correspondences between two data sets, and solving for the optimal transformation that brings these correspondences into alignment. A major difficulty for this approach is the sensitivity to outliers and missing data often observed in 3D scans. Most practical implementations of the ICP algorithm address this issue with a number of heuristics to prune or re-weight correspondences. However, these heuristics can be unreliable and difficult to tune, which often requires substantial manual assistance. We propose a new formulation of the ICP algorithm that avoids these difficulties by formulating the registration optimization using sparsity inducing norms. Our new algorithm retains the simple structure of the ICP algorithm, while achieving superior registration results when dealing with outliers and incomplete data.},

A novel real-time celestial navigation (RCN) method is proposed to solve this problem, which is based on celestial observation and output of angular rate gyroscope. In this paper, the star's direction vector from star sensor is treated as observation for system measurement equation; kinematics model is established using this angular velocity current statistical model (ACSM) for the rover, and its attitude quaternion differential equation is treated as system state equation. Finally, the extended Kalman filter (EKF) gives the solutions of rover's position, heading and attitude. Simulation results show that this method could obtain higher celestial navigation accuracy in real-time.},

abstract = {As an important component of urban vegetation, street trees play an important role in maintenance of environmental quality, aesthetic beauty of urban landscape, and social service for inhabitants. Acquiring accurate and up-to-date inventory information for street trees is required for urban horticultural planning, and municipal urban forest management. This paper presents a new Voxel-based Marked Neighborhood Searching (VMNS) method for efficiently identifying street trees and deriving their morphological parameters from Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS) point cloud data. The VMNS method consists of six technical components: voxelization, calculating values of voxels, searching and marking neighborhoods, extracting potential trees, deriving morphological parameters, and eliminating pole-like objects other than trees. The method is validated and evaluated through two case studies. The evaluation results show that the completeness and correctness of our method for street tree detection are over 98\%. The derived morphological parameters, including tree height, crown diameter, diameter at breast height (DBH), and crown base height (CBH), are in a good agreement with the field measurements. Our method provides an effective tool for extracting various morphological parameters for individual street trees from MLS point cloud data.},

abstract = {The ICP (Iterative Closest Point) algorithm is widely used for ge- ometric alignment of three-dimensional models when an initial estimate of the relative pose is known. Many variants of ICP have been proposed, affecting all phases of the algorithm from the se- lection and matching of points to the minimization strategy. We enumerate and classify many of these variants, and evaluate their effect on the speed with which the correct alignment is reached. In order to improve convergence for nearly-flat meshes with small features, such as inscribed surfaces, we introduce a new variant based on uniform sampling of the space of normals. We conclude by proposing a combination of ICP variants optimized for high speed. We demonstrate an implementation that is able to align two range images in a few tens of milliseconds, assuming a good initial guess. This capability has potential application to real-time 3D model acquisition and model-based tracking.},

abstract = {Outlier detection in laser scanner point clouds is an essential process before the modelling step. However, the number of points in the generated point cloud is in the order of million points, so (semi) automatic approaches are necessary. Having introduced the sources of outliers in typical laser scanner point clouds, an outlier detection algorithm using a density based algorithm is addressed. The algorithm is chosen due to its unconstrained behaviour to the preliminary knowledge of the scanned scene and the independency to the varying density of the points. The algorithm efficiency is assessed by a test on an aerial laser scanner point cloud. The assessment is done with respect to a DSM obtained by photogrammetric methods. The type I and type II errors are estimated and the results are reported. Some examples in terrestrial laser scanner point clouds are also presented and the behaviour of the algorithm on the data sets are shown and discussed. Although the algorithm dose not detect all outlier clusters, the detection of single outliers and even cluster outliers with lower density than a predefined value seems satisfactory, specially the results in the boundary of occlusions. Detection of such outliers is important because if they remain in the data set, they may cause modelling errors in the next modelling step. 1.},

abstract = {The paper presents an enhanced dead reckoning system that fuses data coming from odometry and gyroscope for a more reliable position estimate. Taking into account noise and drift properties of both odometry and gyroscope, and employing some rule-based algorithm, the system improves local self-localization by reducing the effect of non-systematic odometric errors caused by unpredictable bumps or uncertainty encountered in the navigation environment. Another type of error which may occur in passive robots has been considered, e.g. lifting up the iWalker and performing some rotational motion while the contact between the rear wheels and the ground is lost. The bias term of the angular rate sensor has been estimated by Extended Kalman Filter every time the walker temporarily stops. The performance of the proposed localization system has been tested on the iWalker platform for both normal and abnormal cases. Experimental results show the efficiency of this low cost dead reckoning system.},

@article{Wan2002,
abstract = {This paper points out the flaws in using the extended Kalman
filter (EKE) and introduces an improvement, the unscented Kalman filter
(UKF), proposed by Julier and Uhlman (1997). A central and vital
operation performed in the Kalman filter is the propagation of a
Gaussian random variable (GRV) through the system dynamics. In the EKF
the state distribution is approximated by a GRV, which is then
propagated analytically through the first-order linearization of the
nonlinear system. This can introduce large errors in the true posterior
mean and covariance of the transformed GRV, which may lead to
sub-optimal performance and sometimes divergence of the filter. The UKF
addresses this problem by using a deterministic sampling approach. The
state distribution is again approximated by a GRV, but is now
represented using a minimal set of carefully chosen sample points. These
sample points completely capture the true mean and covariance of the
GRV, and when propagated through the true nonlinear system, captures the
posterior mean and covariance accurately to the 3rd order (Taylor series
expansion) for any nonlinearity. The EKF in contrast, only achieves
first-order accuracy. Remarkably, the computational complexity of the
UKF is the same order as that of the EKF. Julier and Uhlman demonstrated
the substantial performance gains of the UKF in the context of
state-estimation for nonlinear control. Machine learning problems were
not considered. We extend the use of the UKF to a broader class of
nonlinear estimation problems, including nonlinear system
identification, training of neural networks, and dual estimation
problems. In this paper, the algorithms are further developed and
illustrated with a number of additional examples},

More concretely, we present several optimizations that reduce their computation times drastically by either caching previously computed values or by revising their theoretical formulations. The latter results in a new type of local features, called Fast Point Feature Histograms (FPFH), which retain most of the discriminative power of the PFH. Moreover, we propose an algorithm for the online computation of FPFH features for realtime applications. To validate our results we demonstrate their efficiency for 3D registration and propose a new sample consensus based method for bringing two datasets into the convergence basin of a local non-linear optimizer: SAC-IA (SAmple Consensus Initial Alignment).},

abstract = {The Kalman filter(KF) is one of the most widely used methods for tracking and estimation due to its simplicity, optimality, tractability and robustness. However, the application of the KF to nonlinear systems can be difficult. The most common approach is to use the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) which simply linearises all nonlinear models so that the traditional linear Kalman filter can be applied. Although the EKF (in its many forms) is a widely used filtering strategy, over thirty years of experience with it has led to a general consensus within the tracking and control community that it is difficult to implement, difficult to tune, and only reliable for systems which are almost linear on the time scale of the update intervals. In this paper a new linear estimator is developed and demonstrated. Using the principle that a set of discretely sampled points can be used to parameterise mean and covariance, the estimator yields performance equivalent to the KF for linear systems yet generalises elegantly to nonlinear systems without the linearisation steps required by the EKF. We show analytically that the expected performance of the new approach is superior to that of the EKF and, in fact, is directly comparable to that of the second order Gauss filter. The method is not restricted to assuming that the distributions of noise sources are Gaussian. We argue that the ease of implementation and more accurate estimation features of the new filter recommend its use over the EKF in virtually all applications.},

@article{Kalman1960,
abstract = {The classical filtering and prediction problem is re-examined using the Bode- Shannon representation of random processes and the “state transition” method of analysis of dynamic systems. New results are: (1) The formulation and methods of solution of the problem apply without modifica- tion to stationary and nonstationary statistics and to growing-memory and infinite- memory filters. (2) A nonlinear difference (or differential) equation is derived for the covariance matrix of the optimal estimation error. From the solution of this equation the co- efficients of the difference (or differential) equation of the optimal linear filter are ob- tained without further calculations. (3) The filtering problem is shown to be the dual of the noise-free regulator problem. The new method developed here is applied to two well-known problems, confirming and extending earlier results. The discussion is largely self-contained and proceeds from first principles; basic concepts of the theory of random processes are reviewed in the Appendix. Introduction},

@article{Chen2003b,
abstract = {In this self-contained survey/review paper, we system- atically investigate the roots of Bayesian filtering as well as its rich leaves in the literature. Stochastic filtering theory is briefly reviewed with emphasis on nonlinear and non-Gaussian filtering. Following the Bayesian statistics, different Bayesian filtering techniques are de- veloped given different scenarios. Under linear quadratic Gaussian circumstance, the celebrated Kalman filter can be derived within the Bayesian framework. Optimal/suboptimal nonlinear filtering tech- niques are extensively investigated. In particular, we focus our at- tention on the Bayesian filtering approach based on sequential Monte Carlo sampling, the so-called particle filters. Many variants of the particle filter as well as their features (strengths and weaknesses) are discussed. Related theoretical and practical issues are addressed in detail. In addition, some other (new) directions on Bayesian filtering are also explored.},

@article{Fischler1981,
abstract = {A new paradigm, Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC), for fitting a model to experimental data is introduced. RANSAC is capable of interpreting/smoothing data containing a significant percentage of gross errors, and is thus ideally suited for applications in automated image analysis where interpretation is based on the data provided by error-prone feature detectors. A major portion of this paper describes the application of RANSAC to the Location Determination Problem (LDP): Given an image depicting a set of landmarks with known locations, determine that point in space from which the image was obtained. In response to a RANSAC requirement, new results are derived on the minimum number of landmarks needed to obtain a solution, and algorithms are presented for computing these minimum-landmark solutions in closed form. These results provide the basis for an automatic system that can solve the LDP under difficult viewing},
